             * enclose literal IPv6 addresses in square brackets, instead of using a comma to separate the port.                       
             * of .chaddr and .+bot to use space as a port separator instead of ':'. Changed the syntax of server list entries to      
             * Made it possible to specify ssl independently for telnet and user ports when modifying bot addresses. Changed the syntax
             * to write to it later.                                                                                                   
  2010-10-31 * Fixed dcc_telnet_pass() to not use a constant string with fingerprint authentication, because strip_telnet() may attempt
             * settings.

  2010-10-14 * Fixed dns.mod on QNX6/Mac OS X/Solaris Rewrote dns.mod's autoconf checks to detect the resolver library properly on     
             * operators to set global bans.                                                                                           
  2010-10-11 * Altered the permission check on the pls/mns ban/exempt/invite commands from USER_MASTER to USER_OP to allow global      
             * options.
